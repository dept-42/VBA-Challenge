I used microsoft VSB information pages.
I also used this posting for strategy to loop through all workshgeets in 
a workbook: https://www.statology.org/vba-loop-through-worksheets/
Sub LoopSheets()

Dim ws As Worksheet

For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets

    ws.Range("A1").Value = 100

Next ws

End Sub

I also encountered a known bug effecting VSB on Mac (as evidenced by many web references)
I tried to set the variable <quarterlyCloseingPrice> to the value of 
<previousCloseingPrice> -- this was simply for readability and was not needed, so i left thjis out. 
The known bug is assigning one double to another doubl which sometime throws an exception.
